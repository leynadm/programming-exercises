# Exercism.io JavaScript Track Solutions

This repo holds my solutions to the JavaScript exercises found on the [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) platform.

After spending a good chunk of time building bigger, full-stack web apps (check my other repositories) applications, it turned out it could be useful to revisit the fundamentals blocks of JavaScript. 

I will use this Exercism to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript, from the ground up.

The exercises I'll showcase here cover those core concepts and are designed to increase in difficulty every day. My objective is to tackle at least one problem perday, to keep challenging my understanding of the basics, which I expect to be helpful not just for potential interviews, but for day-to-day coding and becoming a more solid developer overall. 

It's easy to forget the nuances when you're focused on frameworks and architecture, so this is my way of keeping those foundational skills polished.

Feel free to browse around, also please bear in mind it's an ongoing process!
